# Segmentation of abdominal organs from medical images

This project shows the training and evaluation process of a deep learning model for multiclass semantic segmentation task. The task was to segment four abdominal organs from medical images: liver, right kidney, left kidney and spleen. Dataset used for the training process is the CHAOS(Combined Healthy Abdominal Organ Segmentation) dataset which contains CT scans of the abdominal region in DICOM format with their corresponding masks in PNG format. The training process was done on a basic UNet model which gives good results in segmentation tasks on medical images like CT and MRI scans. During the training process, the loss function combines Binary Cross Entropy(BCE) and Dice-SÃ¸rensen coefficient, both of which are logged into the console and monitored and visualized using TensorBoard. Additionally, Intersection over Union(IoU) was used to evaluate the accuracy of the model and is also logged into the console and monitored and visualized in TensorBoard. After the training process, there is an independent testing process which displays model predictions on the validation and test dataset. The project was done in PyTorch.
